# `Pyneapple`

**Pyneapple** is an open-source Python library for scalable and enriched spatial data analysis. The regionalization module provides the algorithm for the generalized p-regions problem, the scalable max-p-regions solution, and the expressive max-p-regions problem solution. The spatial regression module provides the scalable Multi-scale Geographically Weighted Regression method. It is under development for the inclusion of newly proposed algorithms for scalable spatial analysis methods.
