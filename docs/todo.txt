Java:

J1, Merge the code to the package. Make sure the project compiles. All algorithms should compile to a single .jar file for the python APIs. There should be only one Java project in the Java folder.
	a. Algorithms to package edu.ucr.cs.pyneapple.regionalization. The class should implement the RegionalizationMethod interface and override the interface functions
	b. Utilities classes to edu.ucr.cs.pyneapple.utils
	c. Test cases to test\java\edu\ucr\cs\pyneapple\regionalization. Please make sure the test cases follow the junit.framework.TestCase format.
J2, Write javadoc documentation for all public functions
	Note: if there is some error related to src.zip when using java 1.8, try unzipping and removing the zip file.

Python:
P1, Confirm the documentation of the Python APIs and move the files to the corresponding directory
	a. The .py files for the python APIs should be under pyneapple.regionalization
	b. The test cases in Pyneapple/Python/tests, the file name should be test_xxx.py
P2, Make sure the functions can be called by regionalization.xxx when the module is imported. 
	Make sure that the notebooks under /notebooks can run online in the binder environment. The packages should be imported as pyneapple.regionalization.xxx
	If the binder takes too long to load, please try to run the notebook after installing the package after installing the package by running
	pip install .
	at the root directory or
	pip install git+https://github.com/MagdyLab/Pyneapple.git@main

To generate the python documentation website: run "make html" under this folder. The generated html files are in build/html

The generated javadoc is in ../JavaDoc

To build the python package, go to the root directory where setup.py is located and run "python setup.py sdist", the package will be created in the /dist folder
